# robot-routing

This program takes as input a JSON file with a grid, obstacles, starting point and ending point. It produces a navigation path based on the algorithm the user runs.
The path is exported to a JSON file so it can be used as input to our robot emulator.

Currently, it implements two random movement algorithms.
